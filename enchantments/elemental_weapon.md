# Elemental Weapon

Originally from the Core Rulebook.

### Elemental Weapon
- **Uses:** Varies
- **Equipment Type:** Any Weapon
- **Effect:** The weapon now holds elemental energy, based on the type of Gem used. Basic Attacks made with this weapon take on the Element in question automatically. Each time the weapon is used in a Spell or Technique, you may pay (Half the Magic or Stamina cost of that attack) in Stamina to make the Spell or Technique take on that element. This also replaces all named Status Effects a Spell or Technique inflicts on foes (except Distracted) with that element’s Status Effect, per the chart below.
Further, the weapon provides an additional benefit to its wielder while it is held or on the Hero’s hip (but not when stored in their pack).
Finally, the user gains access to the Elemental Chaff attack, below.

#### Elemental Chaff
- **Cost:** 6 Stamina
- **Use Requirement:** A Weapon with the Elemental Weapon Enchantment
- **Range:** Cone 2 (Melee Weapons), Line 4 (Ranged Weapons)
- **Damage:** Weapon + (Enchantment Rank), of the weapon’s Element
- **Effect:** Roll To-Hit target’s Concentration; on success, target is inflicted with the element’s corresponding status effect (see the table below).

| Gemstone  | Element  | Status Effect      | Additional Effects       | 
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Diamond | Light | Cursed | Casts light, radius (Rank)       |
| Emerald    | Earth  | Rusted | Resist Rain (Rank)       |
| Onyx     | Darkness    | Sick | Exudes black smoke *       |
| Opal      | Water   | Soaked | Resist Sandstorm (Rank)       |
| Ruby    | Fire  | On Fire | Resist Coldsnap (Rank)       |
| Sapphire    | Ice   | Slowed | Resist Heatwave (Rank)       |
| Topaz | Shock | Off-Balance | Generates Electricity |

*Onyx weapons exude a black smoke that can obscure vision when held steady (IE, placed on the ground, or when held by a user who is not in combat). This smoke may fill a single square, and generally prevents light from shining through. Perception checks made through the smoke take a (Rank) penalty, and light sources within the smoke have their Rank (or radius) reduced by (Rank).
