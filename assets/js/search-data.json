    "content": "When they hear the word “vampire”, Hylians typically think of the Achemen. These monstrous bat-people have served the Calamity for millennia, terrorizing the people of Hyrule in the night. Standing as tall as the average Hylian, Achemen have the monstrous visage of a bat shaped into a man, with long, lanky limbs and short wings. They are covered in a light layer of fur, except on their limbs, and sport two large fangs. They have beady little eyes, ill-suited for the darkness they tend to dwell in. Achemen tend to dwell in caves, occasionally with their fellow monsters, though many venture out and infiltrate the societies of other races in disguise. Strangely, however, despite their ache form’s similarity to Keese, their caves almost never contain actual Keese. Most Achemen prefer the taste of blood, especially from unwilling and struggling citizens of Hyrule. When they can’t get their favorite meal, though, they may settle for any wild (or domesticated) creature they can get their claws on. The more considerate and discreet Achemen mainly eat fruits and insects to gain their sustenance, though if a willing person were to offer their own blood… . Art by Karma . ",

    "title": "History",
    "content": "Acheman begin their lives as simple Ache, monstrous bats not unlike Keese, though somewhat larger. During their formative years they are taken care of by their mothers, and occasionally fathers, until they learn to speak, fly, and perform dark magic. Usually, Ache society can expect an Ache to fly two paths: one in which they learn to disguise themselves as a mortal and live in mortal societies, while others instead learn the magic to become an Acheman. Few know the true origin of the Achemen, though most sages believe they were created from Keese when the Dark Lord saw the devastation that Hyrule’s Loftwing Cavalry rained upon his forces. An ancient book found in the small, riverside hamlet of Nabooru Town contains an interview with a rare, friendly Acheman. This book reports that the Acheman race passes down the legend that they were the ones who inspired the Dark Lord to bring Hyrule into eternal night. Whatever the truth of the matter, the Achemen have lived in Hyrule, be it in caves among their own, or in disguise among the populace they wish to enslave. They plot for the return of the Calamity, when they aren’t actively serving underneath it. As a whole, Acheman colonies are generally anarchic, formed of kin groups usually centered around the eldest female relative. However, intermingling is common, and oftentimes a group of Achemen fly off to establish their own colonies, go exploring, or check to see if the Dark Lord has returned. While kin groups are often named after a matriarch, the biggest divisions in Achemen society are in their philosophy. | The Infiltrators prefer living in mortal societies in disguise, so that they can better understand their prey and to sabotage attempts to fight back against them. Their spycraft most often leads to paranoia among Hylians and Sheikah, and in turn leads to trouble for the Achemen who have abandoned their common cause and try to live among other races. | The Predators live in caves and come out to openly attack mortals during the night, or otherwise actively serve the great evil’s army by scouting, coordinating, and commanding. | The Inventors are the smallest group that serve evil, opting instead to develop new weapons and other methods of defeating their foes. However, the danger they and their inventions present to both mortals and to their fellows (and superiors within the dark forces) means they are the most feared, and thus are often not welcome among Predators, Infiltrators, or factions less involved with matters of conquest and evil. | Neutrals tend to stay out of contact with non-Achemen, unless they are out feeding. They are typically the least known about, because Achemen with this philosophy tend to interact least with Hyrule’s populace. | . In time, however, a few Achemen have grown tired of the constant cycle of conflict and devastation, and have left their home colonies for a change of culture. These few Exiles, or Vagabonds, contain a seed of goodness within them, that sometimes sprouts and encourages them to help improve the world where many of their fellows only destroy. Often, though, they will be shunned, and even attacked, unless – and sometimes even despite – showing their better nature. Most rogue Achemen simply live their lives in solitude, or disguised as a Keese, though a rare few put on a magical disguise and live among others. Art by Karma . ",

    "content": "Acheman tend to place a heavy emphasis on the greater causes, be it serving the Dark Lord or following their own path. Often, without a great cause to dedicate themselves to, an Acheman tends to simply worry about their own survival and little else. When they’re withdrawn, an Acheman may have trouble attaching themselves to a new cause, but if they do, they can become a passionate believer. Acheman work best whenever they have their enemy at a disadvantage, such at night or in dark environments like caves. As such, they often prefer using stealth, hit and run tactics, deception and their flight to take advantage of their environment. When not in a better situation than their enemy, Achemen tend to be more cautious… and will attempt to flip the situation in their favor, or at least try to talk their way out of any confrontation. If nothing else works, then a simple retreat to fight another day is usually called for. Characteristics: Sadistic, Clever, Vengeful, Proactive .

Excepting a few kinds of honey, all Food Ingredients listed in the Core Rulebook’s Appendix are some type of plant or fungus.) . While this led to having a list of Ingredients that should be amenable to a wide variety of diets, it also meant we excluded a staple substance: meat!

    "content": "Surveying for Meat sources is a Nature check, rather than the usual Civilization check. This represents not only finding the source of the Meat (such as a deer in the woods, or a good fishing spot by a river), but also the act of successfully catching and incapacitating the animal(s) in question (snaring a rabbit, spearing a fish, netting a bird). This might be different if you’re specifically searching in a civilized environment, such as hunting for pigeons to eat in a city – but such scavenging is typically frowned upon by town guards, and seen as uncouth by other hunters. It may even be illegal, such as if you rustle someone else’s cattle with the intent to turn them into your next steak dinner. Once the Meat source is scavenged, it is usually incapacitated – the animal is either already dead, or so incapacitated that you need but deliver the final blow. However, at GM discretion, the animals you’re hunting might not be so easily slaughtered, and a fight might break out. Remember: the most dangerous animal is a cornered animal. We would encourage the GM to only do this if the fight might be interesting in any way, or if its results might have other consequences – such as if the Heroes have caught some dangerous, magical creatures; or their fight might alert patrolling soldiers that the Heroes would prefer remain unaware of their presence. In most cases, it’s simply more fun to move directly to harvesting the Meat, so that the proper adventure can continue. ",

As a Master Mode rule, however, GMs may instead require a different Tool, the Butcher’s Knife, for better carving up of meat sources. This Tool is created from Metal materials, just like other Food Harvesting Tools. At GM’s discretion, some creatures might grant other Materials (such as Monster Parts or Cloth) in addition to their Meat. Treat these as Dual-Use Resources – a double-dip bonus for the Heroes! For instance, snagging a full-grown buck might grant not only Meat, but the antlers (as Monster Parts); slaughtering a sheep would grant Meat and Cloth (in the form of its wool). ",

Below, we have three ideas to incorporate Meat into your campaign in more than just a flavorful manner. When a war hero’s statue is destroyed in the middle of the night, the town of Westshrine finds their luck has turned sour: their milk curdles, their crops fail to bloom, and locusts rise from the earth to eat whatever’s left. The townspeople believe they have but one recourse: to create the war hero’s favorite dish, based on notes in his journal, and offer it in sacrifice. Unfortunately, not only does the recipe require several herbs and spices, it calls for that most dangerous game: Cucco. In an effort to forge a peace with a clan of Lizalfos, the leaders of Goponga Village have organized a large feast in the Lizalfos style, complete with lots of meat for their carnivorous guests. However, the cattle that the village set aside for slaughter have gone missing! The town is now desperate to obtain a large quantity of meat, fast, to ensure the feast’s success – and to discover who sabotaged the original cattle drive. The town of Shutoy holds an epic fish-fry competition every year. Famed for its fish-laden waters, cooks and chefs travel from all over to compete in the famous contest. The fish used in the contest must come from Shutoy Lake, but may be prepared with any other spices, meats, fruits, or vegetables – the more exotic and rare the foreign ingredients, the better. The competition is fierce, and can even turn deadly while out on the water. Not only are the winners crowned Champion of Shutoy, but they receive a cooking implement or harvesting tool said to be blessed by the lake’s guardian spirit. ",

    "content": "Self-evident in their design, Bob-ombs have come into being with one purpose: destruction. These mechanical munitions are at the forefront of many conquering armies, blasting holes in fortifications and soldiers alike. Because of this, Bob-ombs have attained a reputation as being merciless, dumb, short-lived, and suicidal. Despite their uniform exterior, within every Bob-omb is a unique mind, and through the efforts of these minds they have begun to stray from their original purpose. Bob-ombs rebelled against their masters, fled, and formed friendships with other people and, most of all, each other. In time they have learned to create, and to work in non-destructive ways. These mechanical marvels have become fighters for freedom, makers of art and buildings and philosophies. This new breed of Bomb-omb has slowly chipped away at that negative stereotype, replacing it with a more positive image consisting of discipline, self-sacrifice, a bombastic attitude, and a tendency for building useful mechanisms the world over. Long after the bloody past, Bob-ombs are just like any other person wherever they live, despite their mechanical and explosive nature. They love, they feud, they mourn and most would not have it any other way. Heroic Bob-ombs are often driven by a single purpose, be it exploration, the delivery of a package, or a promise to a loved one now departed. A few are even inspired to seek out the true origin of the Bob-omb, as none have knowledge of when or where they were “born”. Many scholars speculate that they are created in factories controlled by the tyrants that use them as disposable pawns, but no one has provided any proof one way or another. Others still search for other mechanical races, to better understand the world from a seemingly kindred spirit. ",

In reality, many, but not all, Bob-ombs have hands that are hidden in compartments when they are not in use. Even if a Bob-omb does not have hands, they are still capable of manipulating objects as if they did. Other Bob-ombs have taken a vow of pacifism and have caps on their head instead of a fuse. Yet others lack keys, leading to scholarly speculation that wind-up Bob-ombs are made in the same place as Mechakoopas, and thus aren’t people at all. As mechanical beings, Bob-ombs have a wider palate than their fleshy compatriots, often adding metal shavings and oil to their meals. Art by Nd Cube, et al. ",

His past is shrouded in mystery, but it’s well-known that he commands a massive, multiracial army from his perch on a massive, spiral mountain, well-defended with cannons and savage Chain Chomps. Neji Bombs are Bob-ombs with a digital face, no fuse, different legs, and a key located at the top of their head. They are generally thought of as smarter than the average Bob-omb, at least with certain advanced technology. Chuck-Yas are a unique, mass-produced version of Bob-ombs, trading in two legs for a metal point, and with improved upper body strength and an antenna. These generally do not attack by exploding, but rather by picking up and tossing friends and foes alike. With hard-fought freedom and the luxuries that come with civilization, many Bob-ombs have taken to changing themselves to fit the world around them – or to better find their own true self or reflect their profession. A few have been seen attempting to get bodies that match the people around them, be they human, Hylian, Goron, Toad, and the like. Art by Intelligent Systems . ",

While this single-minded focus might be annoying to some, it can also help a Bob-omb bash through a tough problem like it was a poorly-constructed stone wall. Bob-ombs are often selfless – or perhaps more accurately, fool-hardy – interposing themselves between enemies and themselves, and rely upon their sheer metallic bulk and explosions to ensure no one else gets hurt.

This feat can be taken multiple times. New Feat: Bomb Typing . 3 tokens Effect: Select an upgrade for your Bomb ability. You can now use it. Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time you take this, you can choose a different upgrade. New Feat: Bomb-chu Upgrade . 9 tokens Trait requirement: Bob-omb Effect: You no longer need a weapon to Charge, and can use the Bomb ability after a Charge instead of Basic Attack. In addition, you become a Natural Climber. Special: If you have the Natural Movement (Climb) feat, your tokens for that feat are immediately refunded. New Feat: Crafting Style: Bob-omb . 6 tokens Trait requirement: Smithing 6 Effect: You can choose to use this whenever crafting a weapon. The weapon costs 2 more materials, and is now considered Explosive. New Weapon Property: Explosive . This weapon can be used as a bomb that deals [(rank x2) + 1] damage. If the weapon detonates, the weapon takes 1 durability and is considered to have been used (regardless of whether someone was hurt or not). The fuse can be put out with a Water-element attack or if it is Soaked, and the weapon detonates earlier if it is hit with any Fire or Electric attack, or another bomb’s explosion. Any other attacks that target the weapon is treated as if attacking a weapon, not a bomb. New Feat: Fireproof Bomb Upgrade . 6 tokens Trait requirement: Bob-omb Effect: Your Vulnerability becomes Water and you gain 4 ranks of Heatwave Resistance. New Feat: Water Bomb Upgrade . 6 tokens Trait requirement: Bob-omb Effect: You can use your Wick Lantern bonus while Soaked, and no longer Corrode from being underwater. You can also use your Bomb ability while Soaked or underwater. Note that not all Bomb upgrades are effective underwater. For instance, the Sand-Covered and the Stained status effects will wash away the moment they are applied if the target is underwater. Special: If you have both this feat and Fireproof Bomb Upgrade, your Vulnerability becomes Shock. New Technique: Companion Chucker . 3 tokens Learn requirement: Bob-omb Cost: 4 Stamina Use requirement: adjacent ally Range: Projectile 8 Damage: Combat Effect: You grab and throw an ally at a target. Damage from this attack ignores Defense. Your ally does not take damage from this technique, unless the enemy deals damage upon contact. Your ally lands next to the target. New Technique: Firework . 6 tokens Learn requirement: Bob-omb Cost: Up to (Athletics) Stamina Use requirement: Capable of using your Bomb ability, not underwater Effect: You send yourself flying in a straight line, using Stamina spent on this technique rather than your regular Movement (this can allow you to exceed your movement); once your turn ends, you fall as normal. You use your Bomb ability at the end of this movement. New Technique: Manufacture Ammunition, Lesser . 3 tokens Learn requirement: Armos or Bob-omb Cost: 1 Magic or Stamina (Burn) Use Requirement: At least one empty hand, or space in your inventory. Range: Self Effect: Select either an Arrow or a Bomb. When you use this technique, a single unit of that ammunition appears in your hand, ready to be used. (If your hand is not empty, the ammunition appears in your inventory.) The ammunition is ephemeral, and obviously both magical and temporary to anyone who observes or handles it. This may only create normal Bombs and Arrows. Ammunition made with this technique cannot be used in crafting. The ammunition in question lasts until your next Short or Extended Rest. New Technique: Manufacture Bomb, Greater . 6 tokens Learn requirement: Armos or Bob-omb Cost: 2 Magic or Stamina (Burn) Use Requirement: At least one empty hand, or space in your inventory. Range: Self Effect: Select either a type of Arrow or a type of Bomb, worth no more than 50 Rupees. When you use this technique, a single unit of that ammunition appears in your hand, ready to be used. (If your hand is not empty, the ammunition appears in your inventory.) The ammunition is ephemeral, and obviously both magical and temporary to anyone who observes or handles it. Ammunition made with this spell cannot be used in crafting. The ammunition in question lasts until your next Short or Extended Rest. New Technique: Reactive Bomb . 3 tokens Learn requirement: Bob-omb Cost: 4 Stamina Use requirement: take Fire damage Reaction Effect: You use the Bomb ability, except your damage is equal to the Fire damage you have taken from the attack that triggered this reaction; a Bomb option that does not deal damage still does not deal damage. However, you do not take any damage from that use of Bomb. You can use this reaction even while Helpless and then die beyond the ability of a Small Fairy to recover. New Technique: Torpedo . 3 tokens Learn requirement: Bob-omb, Water Bomb Upgrade Cost: Up to (Athletics) Stamina Use requirement: Swimming Effect: When using this ability, you can send yourself swimming in a straight line, using your Stamina spent rather than your movement (this can allow you to exceed your movement); you can also jump out of the water as part of this technique. You use your Bomb ability at the end of this movement. New Status Effect: Corroded . When a creature becomes Corroded, the creature’s Evasion is reduced by 3 and becomes Slowed. After a metal creature (such a Bob-omb) is damaged in combat when in freshwater, roll 2d6+(Fortitude/2)+Waterborne ranks. On a roll of 10 or less, the creature becomes Corroded. When in saltwater, metal creatures become Corroded after combat. If a creature wears metal armor, the creature becomes Slowed, and their Evasion is reduced by 1 per piece of armor that is Corroded. When a creature wearing metal armor is damaged in combat when in freshwater, roll 2d6+armor rank+Waterborne ranks for each piece of metal armor. On a roll of 10 or less, the piece of armor becomes Corroded. Waterborne rank 5 provides immunity to the Corroded status. The Corroded status can be removed in the same manner as the Rusted status.

    "content": "Below, we have a few simple ideas for how you could encourage your players to make use of this Magical Tool, if they should find it. Of course, this isn’t the limit of possibilities – just a sip from the flask, as it were. A long-forgotten waterwheel sits unused and abandoned. It might be in the middle of a stonework dam, or attached to the side of an abandoned mill, its driving creek long since dried up. This puzzle has a simple, obvious solution: just pour water on the wheel to get it moving again. However, it might serve as the beginning to further puzzles; once the waterwheel starts turning, it may bring other clockwork mechanisms to life within the structure – be they opening doors, moving platforms, crushing gears, or rolling millstones. A cave of roiling lava stands between the Heroes and their goal. Using the Bottle of Endless Water to pour cool water on the boiling liquid rock, they can slowly create a bridge of solidified volcanic rock… but the lava will quickly reheat it back to an untraversable state. On its own, this is just a tense stroll over molten doom… But if you add a few fiery foes to the mix, and make sure that the Heroes know that they must keep pouring water on the lava to keep themselves from sinking in, and you end up with a tension-filled fight that they’ll not soon forget. A sunken ship on the sea’s floor teeters on an underwater precipice. To maneuver through the broken vessel’s upturned corridors and overgrown kelp, the Heroes can use the Flask of Endless Water to fill rooms of the boat, causing the entire vessel to tilt forward or aft. Water-filled rooms might be easier to swim through, but harder to investigate. And of course, filling too many rooms on one side might cause the entire sunken ship to tumble into the abyss… . ",

    "title": "Dyes and Dyeberries",
    "content": ". | Dyeberries | Quest Hooks &amp; Usage Ideas | . Breath of the Wild featured a unique and versatile dyeing system. It allowed players to express themselves by dyeing their armor, at the cost of some items and Rupees. However, as much as Reclaim the Wild shares that goal of self-expression, and as much as we try to follow Breath of the Wild‘s lead in all things, this system simply doesn’t translate well to tabletop RPG play. First and foremost, the Hateno dye method requires knowing the colors of all the varied items and materials Heroes find – which is easier to track in a video game, where each item has an icon unique to it, than when all you have is the spoken word. For another, the method doesn’t translate well to all the things a Hero might want to dye: not only their arms and armor, but their hair, their skin, their ink and chalk, and even their foods. To that end, today, we’re presenting an alternative means to dye one’s items. To do this, we’re going to take a page from the Pokémon anime, of all places, by introducing a new type of item: Dyeberries. We’ll also discuss a few additional reasons you might want to scrounge up some Dyeberries, above and beyond fashion. Check ’em out below! . ",

    "title": "Dyeberries",
    "content": "Art by Pokémon Dream World . Dyeberries are a new type of Food Material. Rather than having effects that boost one’s Traits or other crunchy stats, each Dyeberry has an associated color: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet, Black, or White. While any Dyeberry of a given color will give you that particular hue, higher-quality Dyeberries might give richer, more vibrant colors. (If your GM does not specify a Rank for a Dyeberry, it defaults to Rank 1.) . Dyeberries can be eaten raw, just like other Food Materials; in fact, some people will do this just to temporarily dye their tongues. They can also be used in Dishes and Elixirs, as normal, providing the typical benefit of (Rank) points towards the prepared substance (and tinting it, of course). However, when prepared together with at least one Critter, Dyeberries can make Dyes. Dyes are a new type of Elixir, though unlike most Elixirs, they do not restore any Health, Magic, or Stamina. Instead, using a Dye on an item will change some or all parts of that item to match the consumed Dye. Since a Dye can be made with multiple Dyeberries, you can mix and match the Dyeberries’ colors to get the exact hue you need. The new coloration provided by a Dye is semi-permanent: normal wear and use won’t ruin the new coloration, though a dyed item can be returned to its original hues with an application of Soap. At GM’s discretion, some types of significant exertion might also wash a Dye out: while a peaceful swim likely won’t make your colors run, tumbling over a waterfall very well might. (If something is stained with an uncooked Dyeberry, that discoloration will only last until the next Extended Rest, though the stain can also be treated with Soap, as above.) . Dyes can be used on more than just arms and armor, though. A Dye can be applied to any individual person or item! (Or a quantity of Miscellaneous Tools, Arrows, or Bombs, per the Dye’s Rank and that item type’s specific quantity-crafting tables as in the Core Rulebook.) Here’re some more ideas for ways to use Dyes: . | By applying a Dye to a person, you can dye their hair, apply a henna tattoo, or even (as eye-drops) change their eye color. Skilled Sheikah infiltrators will sometimes do this, as dyes are not detected by the Lens of Truth spell. | By using a Dye on an Ink &amp; Quill set, you can change the color of the ink. Useful for writing festive missives, or otherwise adding some color to your correspondence. | Applying a Dye to a set of Balloons, Candles, or Chalk to give your temporary lighting, writing, or flighting some extra flair. | By applying 3 units of Dye to an Amenity, or 10 units of Dye to a Building, you can change the color of a structure to match your personal tastes. | And of course, you can apply a Dye to any already-prepared Dish or Elixir to give it some extra color (or you can just include Dyeberries in the original recipe). | .

    "content": "The town of Azulia has a curious commandment: all persons in the town must wear at least one blue item. Anyone who fails to wear blue is totally ignored by the townspeople; if one were to bump into an Azulian sans blue, they would act confused, embarrassed – or even afraid. When spoken to by someone wearing some amount of blue, however, they’re quick to sing the praises of a traveling priest named Cyan, and how his teachings have brought peace and prosperity to Azulia. A hidden dungeon is heavily themed on colors. Within it, the floors and fixtures are brightly painted, either red, blue, or green – and similarly-colored foes have a tendency to blend into those hues, becoming more powerful and Harder to Hit. To survive this dungeon’s trials and claim its variegated treasures, Heroes should go in well-armed with Dyeberries and Dyes, to change the colors of enemies, puzzle pieces, and themselves. Mantilla, an Inkling, leads the resistance against the evil wizard Karnyx and his undead minions. She and her rag-tag group, the Hip Hellions, use Splat Bombs to cover parts of the conquered city of Frigiliana with thick, colorful ink. To an untrained eye, this seems like mere grafitti, intended to get under Karnyx’s (lack of) skin… But by wearing deeply-dyed clothing, the Hellions can sneak through the Ink-Daubed terrain, and the Stalfos patrolling the streets never see ’em coming. When the Heroes drop in to help Mantilla’s efforts, they’ll need to get hip to these funky-fresh tactics, or face an uphill battle. ",

While working on the previous article’s Spells, there was one Spell from Zelda history that just didn’t sit right with me: the “Fairy” Spell, from Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. It seemed like it wouldn’t be very useful in a fight, but very useful outside of a battle. So then, it hit me: why not make it into a Song, instead of a Spell? After all, Songs are the perfect place for magical effects that are best suited to solving puzzles and navigating the world, but a poor fit for a fight. And in this article, that’s what we’ve done! We’ve invented a new Song, Fairy’s Frottola. It acts like a kind of souped-up version of Minish Minuet; allowing Heroes to get itsy-bitsy and explore places that they otherwise couldn’t reach. ",

While at this tiny size, your attacks can only deal 1 damage to normal-sized foes. If you are using the “Size Matters” Master Mode rules, your Hit Points and Evasion are affected by your new size appropriately. Persons affected by the Song gain the gossamer wings commonly seen on true Fairies. You are now a Flier (but not a Natural Flier), though you are now no longer a Natural Walker. Finally, you begin glowing with light. You may control the brightness and size of this light, from a Burst (Fortitude) down to a Burst 0 (illuminating only yourself and nothing around you), or even turn it off entirely. You do not gain any of the further benefits of becoming a Fairy (such as being able to speak with animals). Anyone who looks at you with the Lens of Truth Spell active will be able to tell that you are not truly a Fairy. While under the effect of Fairy’s Frottola, you retain access to your typical Racial bonuses. You may still use any Feats, Spells, or Techniques that require your ‘actual’ Race. You also retain your previous appearance, excepting your newly-shrunk size and your temporary fairy wings. The duration of this transformation depends upon your Musical Power, per the table below.

    "content": "Today, we’ve got a quick bit of homebrew, inspired by my players’ actions just the other day: Holiday Lights! . In my Reclaim the Wild campaign, I ran a short sidequest-type adventure, where the players had to save a modern-day town from repeating Christmas every day, caused by an enchanted snowglobe. During that adventure, as the Heroes fled from the roof of a mansion that once held the ensorcelling snowglobe, one of them used a string of electric lights as a makeshift rope to rappel down the manse’s masonry. Both they and I were delighted with this bit of MacGuyver-esque tomfoolery, and the Hero kept the string of lights after the adventure (as well as the other holiday gifts they earned for saving the town). Of course, now that one of my players has a string of lights, I need to decide exactly what they do, and how they work. And if one Hero wants a string of lights, perhaps others will, too – either for their own bungled burglings, or just to decorate their homes and towns. Check ’em out below! . As a note, Holiday Lights are a decidedly technological thing, and may not be well-suited to most Zelda campaign worlds. For instance, while they make sense in a setting like Spirit Tracks, they may feel out of place in a more typical “post-Breath of the Wild” world. If in doubt, discuss with your GM and/or players whether Holiday Lights are appropriate for your game – and if not, maybe decorate trees and windowsills in a more traditional way, using simple Candles! .

These bulbs can be lit when the string is activated, functioning like a lit Candle in every square the string of Holiday Lights occupies. However, these lights cannot be used to start fires, as they do not have an exposed flame. Holiday Lights can only shine while exposed to a suitable source of power, such as a steam engine, a waterwheel, an electrically-enchanted object, or an electrical creature. A small control unit attached to one end of a string of Holiday Lights can be used to turn the lights on, off, or set them to blink in specific patterns. Multiple strings of Holiday Lights may be linked end-to-end, allowing one control unit to manage multiple strings of lights. A single string of Holiday Lights is sufficient to decorate a single Amenity, such as a a Kiosk or Tree. Buildings may require more than one string of Holiday Lights to be fully decorated. ",

Note 3: Giant Boomerangs are treated as Boomerangs for the purposes of any feats, techniques, spells, and other rules that refer to Boomerangs. Note 4: Ranged weapons shoot Arrows, which usually deal Piercing damage. Some arrow types may alter this. The listed Edge type typically applies when using Techniques that do not rely on basic attacks. If Ranged weapons are Thrown, they deal Blunt damage. See below for a master mode involving different ammunition types. Note 5: Quarterstaves may also be known as bō, among numerous other names. They are a shaft of wood, metal, or ancient material long enough to strike with the same range as a Spear, and can be used in many melee basic attacks and techniques that require melee weapons. This is in contrast to the Staff – sometimes called a Magic Staff, Focusing Staff, or Wizard’s Staff – which is an arcane weapon typically used for spellcasting, and incapable of being used to hit people in melee without the use of the Monastic Training feat.

The length of the rope varies: . | 1H Extending weapons have a length equal to (Whipcrack’s range); | 2H Extending weapons have a length equal to (Throw Weapon’s range). | . The weapon can only take damage when used as a Rope.

If you cannot normally glide, you become an Unnatural Glider; if an Unnatural Glider without the Parasol, then you become a Natural Glider. Regardless, you Spend 2 Magic or Stamina (chosen when you take this feat) at the beginning of each of your turns. If you cannot Spend this Magic or Stamina, you let go of the Parasol and begin falling. New Feat: Parasol Save . 3 tokens Effect: You can use your Parasol as a Sailcloth of 1 rank lower.

New Feat: Pole Vaulter . 3 tokens Effect: When wielding a Long weapon, increase your Athletics (Jumping) score by (Rank / 2) if you are jumping from solid ground (as opposed to water or mid-air jumping). This does not stack if you are wielding multiple Long weapons. New Feat: Snapshot . 6 tokens Trait requirement: Agility 3, Combat 3 Effect: Your Ranged Weapons are now also treated as Melee Weapons while you wield them.

When designing Reclaim the Wild, we intentionally kept Magic regimented and simple. This is, after all, how it is generally used by Link in various Zelda games – he learns specific Spells with specific functions, but he can’t create new magical effects out of thin air. Further, the versions of Hyrule we’ve seen throughout the Zelda games rarely had wizards and sorcerers who practiced flamboyant magic in the town square; even the few other Heroes we see were typically scholars, knights, or otherwise lacking in magical prowess. However, players or GMs might want mages to be able to creatively use magic off-the-cuff, free from the shackles of rote, memorized Spells. Heroes in your game may want to craft small illusions to help tell stories by the campfire, douse the whole party in water to clean off after a particularly messy fight, or want to permanently enchant a door against being opened by evil creatures. For cases like these, we present Improvised Magic. This system should be considered a Master Mode rule – it adds complexity, expanding what magically-inclined players can do. It also adds complexity to the GM’s life, since wizardly Heroes can now invent all kinds of new solutions to the problems and obstacles they’ve concocted. ",

    "content": "While Improvised Magic is a versatile tool, it is not all-powerful. It is limited both by your imagination, and also by a few guidelines, below. | Improvised Magic cannot directly inflict damage or heal wounds. However, Improvised Magic can indirectly cause damage – for instance, if you lit a campfire with an Improvised Spell, and someone stepped into that campfire, they would take damage from that fire. Improvised Magic is capable of causing or removing some Status Ailments, though this is typically considered complex magic, carrying with it a real risk of failure. | Improvised Magic cannot create permanent objects. While an Improvised Spell might be able to conjure a flame, form a snowball, or fill a glass of water, it cannot create a sword or a pencil. Anything created by an Improvised Spell is ephemeral and temporary, and when closely inspected, its results can clearly be seen as magical. | You must know a Spell on which to base your Improvised Magic. Without this grounding in the fundamentals of magic, you lack the knowledge and skill to use Improvised Magic. For instance, if you were to decide to chill a glass of water, you would need to know at least one Spell that had some kind of icy effect – be it a spell like Kotake’s Ice Beam, which causes Ice-type damage, or a spell like Blizzagia’s Breath, which doesn’t cause damage but does have obviously ice-related effects. | Improvised Magic can’t let you ignore other rules. For instance, you cannot use Improvised Magic to repair weapons, or to craft weapons without a Forge. | The GM retains final say on what can or cannot be done with Improvised Magic. | . ",

Note that these costs are a little bit more expensive than you might expect for a typical Spell. This is intentional! This higher cost is intended to ensure that Improvised Magic is not a panacea, replacing utility Spells purchased with Tokens. However, don’t let this higher cost dissuade you from using Improvised Magic for trivial concerns! Remember that Spent Magic returns at the end of the encounter or scene.

    "title": "Complexity",
    "content": "Not all Improvised Spells are simple tasks. Complex or complicated tasks, such as repairing a broken bone, may require additional Magic expenditure – and necessitate a Trait check. When a Hero wishes to perform an Improvised Spell with a complex effect that has a real risk of failure, the GM should determine a DC for that effect. Then, multiply the Improvised Spell’s cost by (DC / 10), to determine its actual cost. The Trait rolled for the Spell depends on how its Magic is utilized, determined previously. | If the Magic is Spent, then use Willpower. | If the Magic is Bound, use Arcana. | If the Magic is Burned, use Enchanting. | . If the Hero fails this check, then the Magic is Spent (regardless of whether it would’ve been Bound, Burned, or Spent on success) and the Improvised Spell’s effect fails to take hold or occur. (The GM is at liberty to allow the Improvised Spell to cause some partial effect, depending on the spell, the circumstances, and the closeness of the roll.) The Hero may or may not be able to try again, depending on the Spell and on the results of their failure. Depending on the nature of the Improvised Spell – particularly if it’s being used on a creature – it may instead be better to model the Spell like an attack. In these cases, decide whether Concentration or Vitality is the better defense against the Spell’s effect, and then proceed with rolling To-Hit that defense per normal. Also depending on the nature of the Spell, you might substitute Arcana, Enchanting, or Willpower in place of Accuracy in the To-Hit roll, at the GM’s discretion. As an aside, you may also decide to modify the cost of Improvised Magic based on its complexity, even if you don’t intend to actually roll a Trait Check or roll To-Hit. As with so much else in Improvised Magic, this too is at the GM’s discretion. ",

However, they’re still quite dear to an Inkling as an expression of their personality and style: Inklings will sometimes wrap, curl, bind, or even cut their tentacles in much the same way that other races would style their hair. (Cut Inkling tentacles will regrow, albeit more slowly than hair.) These tentacles can even change color at the Inkling’s whim, influencing the color of Ink they produce. Beyond their tentacles, Inklings have a few other features that immediately distinguish them from Hylians. For one, an Inkling’s eyes are surrounded by black markings, much like a raccoon’s. The teeth in their mouth are pointed and sharp, with two large canines on top and one on the bottom, giving many Inklings a mischievous, toothy grin. Their ears are flat and pointed, like a wider, shorter version of a Hylian’s ears. Inklings are capable of producing copious amounts of Ink, much like a common squid. An Inkling’s Ink is a colorful, sticky goop, matching the hue of their tentacles in that moment. Inklings use their Ink to sign their names, paint graffiti on buildings, mark their territory, or most famously, to cause damage and chaos in combat. Inklings hail from dense, urban cities, founded on small islands or atolls. There, land is scarce, valuable, and often fought over. Inklings have had a number of ‘Turf Wars’ over their history, defending their homes from species that would rise from the sea to claim it as their own. ",

    "content": "Moreso than most, Inklings like to showcase their own personal stylings: an Inkling’s fashion choices speak to their mood, goals, and identity. In Inkling society, being ‘fresh’ (that is, being both unique and true to oneself) is the highest compliment. Inklings are quick to defend territory that they see as ‘theirs’, whether this is actual land, personal property, a philosophical stance, or their fashion choices. Woe betide the fool who decides to encroach on an Inkling’s domain, for they’ll quickly find themselves coated in ink, or worse. In combat, Inklings often prefer to use attacks that hit as much area as they can, to both claim the territory as their own and to inflict pain on their enemies. To that end, two-handed melee weapons, as well as ranged weapons, are often their most preferred kit. To take advantage of their natural evasiveness while in Ink-Daubed territory, many Inkling Heroes prefer to wear Light Armor, or even Civilian gear, prioritizing fresh fashion and speed over defense. Characteristics: Active, Competitive, Fun-Loving, Hip, Playful, Stylish, Territorial . Inkling Names tend to be taken from the names of sea-faring animals, clothing or fashion terms, or words related to water. They might use puns and homophone words based on these terms, as well. Female Names: Bobble, Callie, Flow, Headphones, Inky, Kou, Marina, Paruko, Pearl, Straw . Male Names: Aloha, Argyle, Davy, Goggles, Marley, Noiji, Pugette, Slippy, Splashley . ",

You leave inky prints wherever you walk, and on whatever you touch, reducing all Agility Checks for stealth purposes by 2. When you take damage from an attack while Stained, after the attack resolves, your attacker may choose to consume your Stained status. If they do, you take (Rank of the Weapon you’re being struck by / 2) additional damage, unmodified by Defense, and your Stained status ends. If an attack consumes your Stained status, it cannot also Stain you. You can end your Stained status with a Standard Action. Becoming Soaked cancels out both the Soaked and Stained status, and becoming Stained cancels out both the Soaked and Stained status as well. Stained also ends when you use Soap, or take an Extended Rest. New Terrain: Ink-Daubed . Ink-Daubed: Ink-Daubed Terrain is Difficult Terrain for its creator’s enemies, but not for its creator or any allies of its creator. (Ink-Daubed Terrain created by a neutral party is Difficult Terrain for everyone.) When you fall Prone in Ink-Daubed Terrain, you become Stained. If an Ink-Daubed square is intentionally struck with a Water attack, exposed to water, cleaned with Soap, or left untouched for an Extended Rest, it ceases to be Ink-Daubed. New Feat: Crafting Style: Inkling . 3 Tokens Trait Requirement: Smithing 3 Effect: You may choose to use this whenever crafting a weapon. The weapon has 1 less Attack Power. This weapon is now considered Messy. New Weapon Property: Messy . Once per turn, you may select one foe you have just successfully struck with this weapon, and inflict the Stained status upon them, in addition to the attack’s damage and other effects. New Feat: Thermal Ink . 6 Tokens Trait Requirement: Perception 6, Inkling Effect: You can see objects and foes who are Stained with your Ink, even through solid objects, in darkness, or while they are invisible, up to your normal vision range. This does not allow you to see terrain or creatures around them, nor does it allow you to shoot through walls or otherwise physically bypass obstacles. New Spell: Blooper’s Blast . 6 Tokens Cost: 8 Magic Learn Requirement: Inkling Range: Burst 1 or Blast 3 Damage: Weapon + Willpower Effect: The target squares become Ink-Daubed. Roll To-Hit Target’s Concentration; on success, they become Stained. New Technique: Splattershot . 6 Tokens Cost: 5 Stamina Learn Requirement: Inkling Range: Weapon Damage: Weapon + Combat Effect: Roll To-Hit Target’s Vitality; on success, the target, and all targets within 1 square of the original target, become Stained. (In the statblocks below, the effects of Enchantments on the weapons’ Accuracy, Attack, and Durability are already taken into account.) . New Item: Splat Bomb . Splat Bomb: All squares affected become Ink-Daubed terrain. Roll To-Hit target’s Vitality; on success, target is Stained. To craft Splat Bombs, you must consume two Monster Parts. You transform a number of Bombs into Splat Bombs, based on the Ranks of the Monster Parts used, as per the table in the Core Rulebook (“Crafting Bombs”). ",

Perhaps Link himself makes an appearance, and needs your Heroes’ help to accomplish a task and save the day. Alternatively, perhaps Link died, or was never born – and hitherto-unknown Heroes must now take up the Master Sword and do what needs be done. Famously, the Master Sword is rarely the most powerful sword Link wields.

While the Rebuild the Wild supplement offers a variety of new Buildings and Amenities for Heroes to outfit their towns with, there’s one critical piece of Zelda architecture that it’s been missing: the Pedestal. Pedestals have been a part of Zelda lore since Link to the Past placed their hallowed new creation, the Master Sword, on one. Since then, Pedestals have served a variety of magical purposes: protecting and sealing artifacts of immense power, acting as focal points for potent Magical Songs, or serving as a lock to be opened by some key object. Until now, Heroes have been unable to create their own Pedestals. With this new Building type, though, you can now cement your own legends for future generations. Check it out below! . ",

    "content": "Art by Nintendo . Required Materials: . | 5 Gems | 10 Monster Parts | 15 Ancient Materials | . Song Focus . This Pedestal serves as the focus for a particular Magical Song. While the effect may vary depending on exactly which Song is used, there are a few common threads that bind these types of Pedestals. Note that a Pedestal may only be bound to a single Song, and to a single purpose, and that these choices are permanent. Altering the Song: While standing on this Pedestal, the Song bound to the Pedestal can work in subtly different ways. These effects can be drastically different from what the Song can normally accomplish, but must still relate to the Song’s original purpose in some way. Perhaps the Song of Birds will summon a huge Roc to carry the Heroes to the Sky Temple; or the Song of Command will cause fallen pillars to right themselves, opening a path forward to an ancient tomb. Whatever the effect, it is transitory – should you play the Song elsewhere, it will only have its usual effects. Boosting the Song: While standing on this Pedestal, any Hero who plays the appropriate Song may consider their Perform Trait to be increased by (Pedestal’s Rank) for the purposes of that Song, including for calculating their Musical Power. Note that this can go above usual maximums, which can result in some truly world-shaking musical effects – be sure to work with your GM when determining what your boosted Song accomplishes. Teaching the Song: With the addition of a Sign (or other means) to communicate the particulars of the Song, then anyone who stands on the Pedestal and understands the Sign may learn the Song, without any cost or concern. Even the most tone-deaf Hero can pick up the Song with just a few minutes of practice. (This is most commonly done with the Song of Return, teaching a Song that will return a Hero directly to the Pedestal on which they learned the Song.) . Protected Space . The Pedestal serves as a special, protected space. When creating the Pedestal, specify what people must do to be able to stand on the Pedestal. This may be a complex task, such as “collect three Pendants of Virtue”; or it may be simple and easily achieved, such as “receive the Village Elder’s blessing”. However, the requirement must be based on a person’s actions, not their origins. Anyone who fulfills the Pedestal’s conditions may freely step atop the Pedestal. While on the Pedestal, they are protected from all things outside the Pedestal. Weather effects are reduced by (Pedestal’s Rank), and you may add (Pedestal’s Rank) to your Concentration, Defense, Evasion, and Vitality against any attacks originating from outside the Pedestal’s bounds. Anyone who does not fulfill the Pedestal’s conditions will feel a sense of foreboding and ill-ease when approaching the Pedestal, warning them away. Should they ignore these warnings, any Monsters of a Rank less than (Pedestal’s Rank) will find themselves utterly unable to set foot on the Pedestal – as if running into an invisible wall. Creatures of a Rank greater or equal to the Pedestal’s will find themselves Slowed, and will suffer (Pedestal’s Rank) damage at the end of every turn, ignoring Defense. Weapon Spirit’s Home . This Pedestal serves as the home of a particular Weapon Spirit. The Pedestal must be at least the same Rank as the Weapon Spirit’s Weapon to serve as its home. The Weapon Spirit must be serving you at the time of the Pedestal’s creation, and must agree to make the Pedestal its home. When the Weapon Spirit’s Weapon is placed upon the Pedestal, the Spirit enters a deep slumber. During this time, the Weapon Spirit cannot communicate, but it can sense those who stand on its Pedestal – who they are, what they carry, anything they speak aloud, and their intentions. While slumbering, the Weapon Spirit will slowly rejuvenate itself from even the most grievous injury. This even speeds its recovery from more mundane dents and dings: the Durability of the Weapon the Spirit inhabits will recover an additional (Pedestal’s Rank) Durability each night. In addition, while slumbering, the Weapon Spirit can refuse to be drawn by anyone, for any reason it likes. No force in Hyrule can move the weapon against its will, save perhaps for the Goddesses themselves. ",

    "title": "Phonograph",
    "content": "Phonographs are a minor staple of the Zelda franchise, and serve as a useful shorthand for showcasing how technologically advanced a Zelda game world is: the more advanced their record-playing technology, the more advanced the world itself is. Appearing in Ocarina of Time, Majora’s Mask, Oracle of Seasons, and The Minish Cap, Phonographs have been used to teach Link the notes for Magical Songs, to entertain visiting guests, and to serve as a relaxing way to pass the time with some nice tunes. In Reclaim the Wild, Heroes are sure to find clever uses for Phonographs above and beyond these. Perhaps they’ll secretly record a corrupt noble’s meeting with a dark wizard, or play a recording of themselves shouting and cavorting to distract a guard while they slip into a fortress. Below, for use in your own Reclaim the Wild games, we present a new Mundane Tool, the Phonograph, and its Ammunition, Discs. Art by Sweet Clip Art . Phonograph: (Wood) A device that records and produces sound. A Phonograph might be cranked by hand, powered by a hand-wound spring, or they might be powered by an internal mechanism (such as a magical gem, electricity, or powered by wind or water), depending on the technology level of your game’s world. Phonographs play Discs; without a Disc to play, the Phonograph makes only white noise. A Phonograph’s maximum volume is dependent on its Rank. It can be clearly heard in either a Burst (2+(Rank/2)), or a Cone (5+Rank), and faintly heard at twice those distances. Phonographs can play music while carried; this requires two hands, and Slows the carrying creature. Disc: (Monster Parts) Discs are blank until they’re recorded on, using a Phonograph. Once they’ve been recorded on, a Disc cannot be re-used for recording. However, once recorded, a Disc can be played repeatedly. A single Disc can record up to 5 minutes of speech, music, or other audio. A Disc only requires 2 Monster Parts to craft. Depending on the Rank of Monster Parts used, you can create multiple Discs. Treat this like crafting normal Bombs, using the same chart and rules as in the “Crafting Bombs” section of the Core Rulebook. Most Discs have a Market Price of 20 Rupees, whether or not they are blank, but some valuable or rare recordings may be worth more. Discs go in the Ammunition pouch of your Pack, and are considered Ammunition for Phonographs. Discs do not stack with one another, unless they are of the same recording. Phonographs and Magical Songs: While Discs can record mundane music with high fidelity, they cannot duplicate the arcane power of Magical Songs. When a Magical Song is played from a Disc, it does not produce any magical effects. However, a skilled Performer may be able to learn a Magical Song by listening to a Disc of it; consult your GM. ",

    "content": "One of the most fun parts of a Zelda game is finding the cool new Magical Tools you’ll use to solve puzzles and navigate the world. And of course, tabletop game players love finding new items – and using them to circumvent the GM’s plans. In posts like these, we want to share Magical Tools made for Reclaim the Wild games. And the first one we want to share is a totally original item, the Queen’s Cane! . Queen’s Cane . Magical Tool - One-Handed - Wooden . By tapping the tip of this wooden cane against a surface (including your open hand), you can create fresh beeswax. It was originally used to help build this hive, and was then used to seal individual honeycombs or otherwise perform ceremonial bee-duties. Cost: 1 Stamina (Bind or Burn) Range: Self Effect: You create or destroy a single dollop of beeswax, up to 1 cubic square. Created wax persists until your next Short or Extended Rest. This can be used in a number of ways, limited only by your creativity. Some possibilities include: . | (Bind) Seal an opening (up to 1 sq. in size) with thick, hard wax. This seal is water-tight, but is not heat resistant (it will hold back water, but not lava). The wax is sufficiently sturdy to support a person’s weight. A wax-sealed square can be broken through with a test of Athletics v. the cane-user’s Arcana, or upon contact with any Fire attack or fire source. If the wax is destroyed, the Bound Stamina is Burned. | (Burn) Create a single Candle or bar of Soap. Items created this way last until your next Short or Extended Rest. The item is ephemeral, and obviously both magical and temporary to anyone who observes or handles it. | (Burn) Seal a letter, Bottle, or package with a crest or sigil of your devising. This seal persists until the object is opened. (The seal doesn’t prevent anyone from opening the item, but may reveal if it was tampered with.) | (Bind) Coat a single object in a thin layer of wax. This functions somewhat like using Oil on a piece of equipment, preventing (but not removing) Rust, or lubricating the moving parts of a machine. This wax coating persists until your next Short or Extended Rest. | . The Queen’s Cane is a perfect item to put in a tree- or bee-themed dungeon. While it doesn’t provide any combat utility, it gives clever players lots of ways to solve puzzles and overcome challenges. They can clog up pipes, unseal honeycombs, or even create small platforms. However, the Queen’s Cane could also be in the hands of a noble, using it to affix – and alter – the wax seals on their correspondence. They could also use it to seal bottles of wine, or poison, without touching the object in question. Finally, since the wax from the cane can be used as a lubricant for moving parts, anyone interested in large-scale machinery might want to get their hands on this Magical Tool, if only to save a few Rupees on bulk Oil orders.

Weapons that are Extending by default deal 1 Extra Damage. This technique forms the core of the fighting style in the sport of ARMS. With it you can make melee attacks and Combat Maneuvers like Grapple at a range, using any weapon you like. Activating ARMed and Dangerous may involve putting on the mask required to properly control the ARMS in spiral form. Who should get ARMS? . This is a decision ultimately up to the GM, but here are some ideas: . Anyone: the simplest option, this basically ignores what little lore exists and just allows anyone with the tokens to gain the technique. Only those from the ARMS world: in a game where the various Nintendo settings are separate and meet together – such as in Super Smash Brothers – it may seem best to only allow those from the ARMS world to get the ability. This may be accompanied with various other differences that may provide advantages and disadvantages to each setting. For instance, those from ARMS, Metroid, F-Zero, and Star Fox worlds may know how to drive cars and use computers, while those from a Zelda world may not. Though, unique people from non-ARMS worlds, such as Lanky Kong, may also be able to take the technique. Some people: Though the lore behind the ARMS phenomena is scant, it does provide some basis for selectively allowing certain races to take the technique. Animals and plants gain the gifts, while machines can simply have springlike equipment. In addition, there is Helix, an artificial person that seems to resemble the ooze/slime types of creature that show up in Zelda as chuchus, gels, and zols. The following races may be eligible to receive ARMS on the basis of being an animal, machine, plant, or otherwise thematically appropriate: Acheman, Bob-omb, Deku Scrub, Gerudo, Hylian, Inkling, Keaton, Rito, Sheikah, Talking Animal, Twili, Weapon Spirits that inhabit an Extending weapon (such an ARMS), Zora. The following races would likely not have ARMS, on the basis of being magic or mineral: Demons, Fairies, Gorons, most other Weapon Spirits. The one race that may potentially fit in any of these categories are the Subrosians, due to the mystery of their true nature. A GM is well within their rights to declare them animals, minerals, or magic, and thus (dis)allow the technique as appropriate. ",

While the attributes and elements are not perfectly equivalent, the Elemental Weapon enchantment can serve as a good substitute. As such, the Elemental Blow technique – shown below – approximates the charging of a weapon attribute and attack, with the potential for a secondary effect appropriate to that Element. New Benefit: Elemental Weapon . If your Weapon has the Elemental Weapon enchantment, you gain access to the following technique in addition to Elemental Chaff: . Elemental Blow . Cost: 3 Stamina Use Requirement: A Weapon with the Elemental Weapon Enchantment Range: Weapon Damage: Weapon + (Enchantment Rank), of the weapon’s Element Effect: Roll To-Hit target’s Concentration; on success, target is inflicted with the element’s corresponding status effect (see the table for Elemental Weapon).

Compared to squares, hexes have the following advantages: . | The distance between a hex’s center and its neighbor is always equal, when real-world measurements as used. This is in contrast to a square-grid, where a square’s cardinal neighbors’ centers are closer than the diagonal neighbors’. | For Reclaim the Wild, the difference in diagonal movement described above requires alternating the cost of moving squares. The first diagonal square costs 1 movement, while the second diagonal square costs 2 movement, then the third diagonal square costs 1 movement again… and so on. As such, hexes make diagonal movement simpler, because you just count each hex as a point of movement. | . Likewise, hexes have the following disadvantages: . | As seen in the previous section, movement along one axis cannot be straight. Flat-top hexagons do not allow simple east-west movement, and flat-side hexagons do not allow simple north-south movement. Zig-zagging movement must be used. | Movement happens in 6 directions compared to the 8 in a square-grid map. This may reduce your options to escape, and allows 6 enemies to fully surround a Medium creature rather than 8! | Partial hexes may come up when dealing with structures, which are often created as squares or rectangles.

Gigantic creatures take up thirteen hexes, with a diameter of four hexes. Colossal creatures take up nineteen hexes, with a diameter of five hexes. However, given the open-ended nature of the Colossal size category, they could certainly be even larger! . ",

    "content": "Most attack ranges work the same, just with hexes instead of squares. Just start counting from a hex next to your character, toward your intended target! The main difference with squares is the counting of diagonals. Diagonal movement doesn’t follow the 1-2-1 rule of squares, so diagonal movement is somewhat easier! . Below you will see a collection of various attack ranges, with the blue hex being the user of the ability, and red hexes being the range of the ability. Examples of various Attack Ranges on a hex map . Blast is the first range worth noting, given its explicitly square-like nature that ignores the 1-2-1 diagonal distance counting. At first I thought to make the ranges match up with the equivalent creature size, but ultimately that would make the ranges resemble a circle. Instead, I settled upon a square-like shape, where the length and width of the range are the same. Bursts, lines, and sweeps are mostly the same, though of course there are only six hexes around a medium creature, and diagonal movement is simple to count. Cones work quite fine when the cone begins with two hexes and spreads out from there (see the bottom three figures labeled cone), but work quite strangely when the cone begins with a single hex (see the top three cone figures). Ultimately, the easiest variant was following similar rules as the cones in the base system: X hexes forward, with the width increasing by 2 for every hex forward it moves. The shape looks strange in the abstraction of a hex map, but it mostly works the same. Just check if you’re using the Friendly Fire master mode before you shoot such a cone! . However, if drawing a cardinal-facing cone is too strange or covers too much ground, then just stick to the cones in the bottom half of the image. Below you will see an equivalent map for the “X targets/squares within Y squares” map shown for attack ranges. The brown hexes are enemies, and the purple hexes are cover. As you can see, the hex system has six enemies be within range of the “3 targets in 8 squares” attack, while the square system has five enemies be within range. Example of “3 Targets within 8 Hexes” Attack Range . This is all the information I currently have for using hexadecimals. Let me know if you have any questions!

Reclaim the Wild is a game about, among other things, resource management! You have to manage your materials, your weapon durability, and even your character’s (and companions’) Health, Magic, and Stamina! . Health, of course, is your character’s most important resource, since without it they would be Helpless or even dead! If you’re using Master Mode rules, Health also determines when you suffer a nasty Injury. While Health is what keeps your Hero upright and in the fight, there’s really only one way to use it right now: Burning it, by getting punched in the face. But what if we looked into using it in other ways? . First, let’s go through the implications of Burning, Binding, and Spending Health. ",

    "content": "Burning Health . Health that is Burned is almost exactly the same as taking damage, except that it is done voluntarily and Defense cannot reduce the amount Burned. Unlike taking damage, however, you cannot voluntarily Burn Temporary Health. Burned Health cannot be healed by Spells and Techniques. Instead, it is only healed through consuming Dishes, Elixirs, and through rest. Binding Health . Health that is Bound is temporarily taken from the character’s pool of current health for the purposes of a benefit. When the character decides to Unbind the Health, then the Health will return to their current health. If a Hero is reduced to less than 1 HP while having Bound Health, then Unbind that Health (in whatever order the player chooses, if there are multiple pools of Bound Health) and apply damage as appropriate. However, if the Health cannot be voluntarily Unbound, then the character will fall Helpless. Spending Health . Health that is Spent is similar to taking damage, except that the Health returns after the end of a battle or scene. Do note that if you are attacked while Helpless, you will die, even if your Health has been Spent rather than Burned. A character should have at least 1 Health remaining after Binding, Spending, or Burning Health for any purpose. Otherwise, they’ll collapse and become Helpless! . Of course, all this information on how Health can be Spent, Bound, and Burned is useless without anything to Spend, Bind, and Burn the Health on.

    "title": "Duels and Other Arranged Battles",
    "content": "In Reclaim the Wild, non-serious battles may be costly in terms of resources, despite the lower stakes involved. Any Health that is lost due to damage usually won’t return without consuming a Dish or Elixir, taking a Long Rest, or Burning Magic using healing spells. However, there might come a time when two characters may come to blows, be it to resolve a disagreement, uphold honor, test the other’s strength, or just for fun. If the cost for such a small-stakes battle is high, such as needing to spend time, money, or dishes recovering health, then perhaps the battle may not happen, at the cost of a good story. The following rules can be used to reduce the cost of health recovery, by having characters Spend rather than Burn Health over the course of a battle. First, consent should be obtained from all the players (and the GM) at the table. Just because rules for Hero-on-Hero battles exist, does not mean they should be forced onto an unwilling group. Everyone’s play style should be taken into consideration, so that no one is uncomfortable, resentful or bored. Some players would prefer that a Hero-to-Hero disagreement be resolved with words. Others would rather not stand around watching two people beat each other up. And a few may even have had poor experience with dueling in their real life. If the participants of an arranged battle agree – either explicitly or implicitly – to not fight to death (or are ordered to, in the case of instinctive or limited intelligence combatants), then the Game Master may allow the participants to Spend Health whenever they take damage, rather than Burn. Generally, NPCs may only agree to an arranged battle if they of a semi-friendly disposition toward the Hero, such as if they are fellows in the same society, or are part of a sports or combat tournament where non-lethal combat is the norm. Very rarely will the servants of a great evil agree to a duel; typically, honorable people do not serve great evils. Instinctive and limited intelligence combatants do not understand arranged battles, and will not follow their rules unless instructed otherwise. The GM has the right to not use these rules, and NPCs cannot be compelled to use them. All damage is resolved the same way, applying Defense and Resistance as appropriate, and the amount is reduced from the character’s temporary and total health. Once reduced to 0 Health, the character cannot fight any longer, and is removed from the battle. When the battle concludes, all participants can stand up, restored to the Health they had before the arranged Battle began. The Heroes will be dirty and scuffed, but little worse for the wear. If Master Mode is used, do not apply Injuries. As an optional rule, the GM may decide that some combat wear remains. Perhaps all Health is restored, except for 1 Point. If Master Mode is used, then perhaps up to 1 Injury should be applied. This will prevent even the mightiest of heroes from dueling dozens of times without any rest. If durability is a concern, sparring weapons could be used. Perhaps the participants could agree to not use their best armor and weaponry, or they can be provided a standardized set of gear if the arranged battle is through an organization. Level 0 weapons and armor could be crafted or bought. Arranged Battle Usage Ideas . A Gerudo woman, having left home for the first time, is eager to prove herself to the people of Hyrule – perhaps not understanding the local culture. She stands up onto a bar’s table and issues an open challenge! Perhaps she’s just drunk, perhaps she offers a cash reward, or perhaps she is looking for someone stronger than her to help her with a problem! . A particularly famous singer in Inkopolis desires for her chosen side in this week’s Splatfest to be victorious. Though she has valuable information, she will refuse to part with it unless the group enters and wins a Splatfest battle. Victory in a Splatfest comes through territorial control, but interrupting the efforts of the enemy team is a very effective and common strategy! . The Picori Festival is held every year in Hyrule Town. As part of the festivities, a martial arts tournament is held, where the winner will get to touch the sacred Picori Blade that was once used to seal away evil! . ",

Blood Tribute may be more appropriate for the darker shade of heroism (or even villainy!), depending on the tone of the game, but even a self-sacrificial paragon may use their own blood to power their abilities! . Though the feat may provide more opportunities to use Techniques and Spells, Health is a precious resource, so Heroes will not become too much stronger by taking this feat, compared to anything else.

Curled inside its metal casing is a long metal chain. When the trigger is pulled, the hook fires straight ahead, grabbing onto whatever it hits, and attempts to retract. A Hookshot that uses Magic may instead be a hollow cylinder with runes inscribed on the outside. With the use of Magic, a hook made of energy forms and fires at the directed location.

This creates a Hookshot of that Rank. (You can, of course, use higher-Ranked Materials, but the Hookshot will be of the lowest-Ranked unit of Material used in its construction.) . The Rank of Materials you can use to craft a Hookshot is limited by your Mechanics Trait: you may only use Materials of a Rank equal to (Mechanics / 2, rounded down) or less. Deconstructing a Hookshot . Deconstructing a Hookshot typically returns 1 Cloth, 2 Ancient Materials, and 4 Metal, of the Hookshot’s Rank. If the Hookshot was made with a different combination of Cloth, Metal and Ancient material than is typical, then you might get back a different amount of those Materials, based on that ratio. Or, for simplicity, you could just get back 4 Metal and 1 Cloth, even if Metal and Cloth were not used in construction of the Hookshot. Upgrading a Hookshot . Hookshots can be upgraded, allowing you to improve their abilities and alter their Personal Touches (see below). Upgrading a Hookshot is mechanically the same as creating a new Hookshot, and deconstructing the old Hookshot at the same time: you consume Materials to create your new Hookshot at the new Rank, and you receive the Materials of the Hookshot’s old Rank from deconstructing it. Personal Touches . When you craft or upgrade a Hookshot, you also decide on its Personal Touches, much like when you build a Castle using the rules found in Rebuild the Wild. Hookshots may have up to (Rank) many Personal Touches. Each Personal Touch may only be taken once, unless otherwise stated. When you upgrade a Hookshot, you may change any existing Personal Touches it had, in addition to adding new Personal Touches based on its Rank. Below are just a handful of the Personal Touches your Hookshot might have – but don’t be afraid to discuss your own ideas for Personal Touches with your GM! . | Attuned: This Hookshot is specifically attuned to you. Treat this as if the Hookshot had the “Loyal” Enchantment on it, of a Rank equal to the Hookshot’s Rank. Further, anyone who does not have your explicit permission to use the Hookshot will treat the target of any of the Spells or Techniques granted by the Hookshot as being Hard to Hit. | Belt-Mounted: You may use your Hookshot if it is in one of your Belt slots, without needing a free hand. | Extension Lock: You can decide to keep the Hookshot’s chain extended once you’ve fired it, rather than immediately reeling it in. While locked, a taut chain extends in a straight line between you and the target, preventing either of you from moving any further from the other (though you may move closer, reeling in the chain as you approach). When someone attempts to move through the chain, you may attempt a special Combat Maneuver as a Reaction: Athletics and Perception vs. Concentration; on success, the target is immediately Knocked Prone. As long as the chain is taut, your allies can also walk along the chain like a tightrope; an Agility or Athletics trait check may be necessary to do so. | Failsafe: When you use the Hookshot Spell, you learn whether the target is lighter or heavier than yourself. You may then choose to have the Spell fail, preventing any movement. For instance, if you learn that a tree branch you used the Hookshot on is lighter than you, you can engage the failsafe and prevent the Hookshot from reeling the tree branch towards you. | Hookshot Expertise: When you target a willing ally with Ravio’s Hookshot, you can choose to pull yourself toward your ally, or your ally toward yourself, regardless of your relative weights. You can always target an ally with Wings of Freedom and be pulled toward them, regardless of your relative weights. | Hookshot Save: You gain the Hookshot Save Spell. You can cast it even if your Hookshot is in your Belt slot and you do not have the Belt-Mounted Personal Touch; you replace anything in one Hand with your Hookshot as part of casting that spell. | Jabu-Jabu’s Switchhook: You can use the Jabu-Jabu’s Switchhook Spell, using the same resource (Magic or Stamina) as with Ravio’s Hookshot, with the same benefits. | Pinpoint Shot: When rolling To-Hit using Spells and Techniques granted by the Hookshot, increase your roll by (1 + (Rank / 2)). | Practiced Efficiency: Reduce the cost of using all the Spells and Techniques granted by the Hookshot by 25%, as if you have taken the Practiced Efficiency feat for all of them. | Reinforced: The Hookshot gains (Rank + 1) extra Durability. | Shrinkable: This Hookshot can shrink and grow back to size on command. It can be safely placed within a Pack’s Key Items pouch, rather than in the Tools pouch. It can also easily be used when the Hero is under the effects of any shrinking effects that the Hookshot was not also affected by. | Wings of Freedom: You can use the Wings of Freedom Spell, using the same resource (Magic or Stamina) as with Ravio’s Hookshot, with the same benefits. | Yank Closer: You can use the Yank Closer Spell, using the same resource (Magic or Stamina) as with Ravio’s Hookshot, with the same benefits. | .

The Hylian can also use Wings of Freedom to aim the Hookshot at the purple block above the southern set of pits. He can swing over eastward toward the Moblin, then northward. However, he would not be able to swing past the northern pit; as such, he’d have to use the hookshot on the block directly north of him.

For many centuries, Hyruleans have enjoyed shield-surfing as a pastime, as a sport, and a means of transportation. To that extent, they have created tools dedicated to shield surfing, and shield surfing-adjacent activities, suited for more than just a snowy mountaintop! . In honor of December, here a few of those tools! As well as new feats and techniques to enjoy Shield Surfing! . ",

    "content": "Despite people calling the sport ‘shield surfing’, shields are not actually suited for shield surfing, and will eventually break from prolonged use. For those who don’t want to spend a fortune buying or crafting shields for competitions or just daily travel, these Surfing Tools are a goddess-send! . By default, Surfing Tools do not take Durability damage when used for Shield Surfing in the terrain they were designed for. If a Surfing Tool is used for a surface it isn’t designed for, the Tool may either take durability damage, or may simply not work… A skateboard would simply sink into the snow, or into water, rather than provide even a modicum of movement. Surfing Tools are a subset of Mundane Tools and can be made from Ancient, Metal, or Wood Materials. Like other Mundane Tools, Surfing Tools come in ranks. When in their designated terrain, the tools gain (Rank) to Movement when Shield Surfing, before taking into account the surfing boost, and they add their (Rank) to any trait rolls made for moving through or stopping. For instance, when using ice skates on a frozen lake (a severely slick surface, in this case), you can add the ice skates’ rank to your Agility roll to safely stop! . Finally, every type of Surfing Tool provides a miscellaneous benefit as listed in the table below. This benefit applies while Shield Surfing, and also while using the Surfing Tool when not Shield Surfing. Surfing Tools can also be used on relatively flat surfaces, using the same actions as Shield Surfing. However, unlike with Shield Surfing, when used in this way Surfing Tools normally do not provide the (Rank) bonus to Movement, not do you gain a multiplier to their Movement or any other benefit derived from Shield Surfing beyond the miscellaneous benefits listed below. Types of Surfing Tools . | Tool | Terrain | Misc Benefit | . | Skiis, Snowboards | Snow | Ignores difficult terrain caused by deep snow | . | Ice skates | Ice | Can roll twice to use Sand Attack on ice | . | Skates, Skateboards | Solid terrain such as dirt, metal, stone, etc | Gain Movement bonus even when not Shield Surfing | . | Surfboard | Water | Floats naturally in liquids | . | Sandboard | Sand | Ignores difficult terrain caused by deep and quick sand | . Other surfing tools may exist for other forms of terrain. Perhaps Subrosians have figured out a means of lava surfing! . ",

    "content": "Shield Surfing on a Weapon Spirit . Back in May, Elemental Knight shared Avara’s Weapon Spirit race. One possibility that came up in the process of writing this article is riding upon a Weapon Spirit’s Shield. If you are Shield Surfing on a Weapon Spirit, you are treated as mounting the Weapon Spirit. Thus, neither of you can use Combat Maneuvers, Spells or Techniques. New Weapon Enchantment: Shredding . Uses: Emerald Equipment Type: Shield Effect: While Shield Surfing, your Movement is increased by (Rank / 2) before taking into account the shield surfing boost, and Durability consumption per ride is capped out at (5 – Rank) Durability. New Feat: Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop . 6 tokens Trait requirements: Selmie’s Surfing Style, Athletics 6 Effect: You can Shield Surf on level ground, though your movement is not increased beyond the static Movement bonus from your Surfing Tool or a Shield with the Shredding enchantment. You can also Shield Surf uphill, but you are Slowed while doing so. In addition, if you move your full Movement while Shield Surfing, you become Hard to Hit until the beginning of your next turn. New Feat: Selmie’s Surfing Style . 3 tokens Trait Requirement: Athletics 3 Effect: When Shield Surfing with at least one empty hand, you can use the shield you are surfing on as if you had it equipped in your hand. For instance, the shield can be used for Basic Attacks, Combat Maneuvers, Reactions, etc, and the enchantment on the shield can apply to you as appropriate. Also, you can use Spells and Techniques if you are surfing on a Weapon Spirit. In addition, your surfing Shield’s damage rating increases by 2. New Feat: Surfer’s Alacrity . 3 tokens Trait Requirement: Selmie’s Surfing Style, Agility 3 Effect: You may start or stop Shield Surfing as a Free Action, once per turn. New Feat: Surfing Spirit . 3 tokens Trait Requirement: Athletics 3, Weapon Spirit Effect: You may use Combat Maneuvers, Spells, and Techniques while being used for Shield Surfing. If you make an attack as a Shield while being used as a surfing Shield, your damage rating increases by 2. New Technique: Link’s Bomb Boost . 3 tokens Cost: 1 Stamina Use Requirement: Shield Surfing Reaction Effect: If you are hit by a bomb explosion while shield surfing, you reduce the damage received by 50%, after applying Resistance. In addition, you can choose to be launched a number of squares in any direction equal to or less than the base damage of the bomb’s explosion, in addition to any Bomb’s regular Push effects. New Technique: Selmie’s Shield Slam . 6 tokens Learn Requirement: Selmie’s Surfing Style Cost: 12 Stamina Use Requirement: Shield Surfing on a Shield Range: (Horizontal Jump) Damage: Weapon + Combat + Athletics Effect: You jump towards your target in a straight line and slam your surfing Shield into them.

You may then jump off of the target, again using your horizontal jump (you cannot remain atop the target). Roll To-Hit target’s Vitality; on success, you push them one square in a direction of your choice. This attack cannot be performed if you are Halted or Slowed. Kip-Up Kick . 6 Tokens Cost: 5 Stamina Learn Requirement: Push-Off Kick Use Requirement: Your legs must be free, you must be able to move, and you are currently Prone. Range: Melee Damage: Weapon + Combat Effect: You stand up from Prone. Roll To-Hit target’s Vitality; on success, you push them away from you one square, and push yourself one square away from them. (This should leave two squares between the two of you.) . Quick Change . 6 Tokens Cost: 1 Stamina per item swapped Range: Self Minor Action Effect: You can swap out any number of items from your Hands, Hip, or that you are currently wearing, with items in your Pack or elsewhere on your person. Each swap costs 1 Stamina – for instance, changing out your current Chest armor for a different Chest armor would cost 1 Stamina, as would swapping your equipped sword and shield for a greatsword. Special: If you cast the Spell Impa’s Disguise or Vanish (or another disguising, illusory, teleportation, or otherwise self-obscuring effect) as your Standard Action this turn, the visual effect is seamless. For example, you could use this with Impa’s Disguise to quickly transform into a differently-equipped, visually distinct alter ego at a moment’s notice. Whether this transformation serves to hide your identity or otherwise confound the enemy is up to you and the GM to determine. Sudden Substitute . Might also be known as Kakariko Kawarimi or Stump Swap . 9 Tokens Cost: 12 Stamina Learn Requirement: Vanish or Quick Change Use Requirement: You are hit by a Line, Melee, or Sweep attack; and you are able to move Range: Self Reaction Effect: You disappear in a puff of smoke, leaving a rough-hewn log or other rough facsimile of yourself in your place. You suffer no damage from the attack, nor any other effects (ailments, forced movement, etc.). You may move half your Movement away from the decoy’s location before reappearing; you are invisible during this movement. Roll To-Hit target’s Concentration; on success, the decoy object is not destroyed, and the target is Distracted by the decoy object. (The decoy object has 1 HP, no Defense, and no Guard Stats.)

Some say it’s attunement to the hidden is a demon’s curse, drawing the holder to things they were never meant to find. Others have suggested it might be a trapped spirit, struggling to break free when it senses something amiss. Whatever the case, the Stone exacts a toll on those who use it. What few texts even mention it in passing suggest it has some connection to the Lens of Truth. As an unusual Magical Tool, the Stone of Agony is only required to be in a Hand or on your Belt, and is passively activated when you fail a Perception check. With the Stone equipped, you will always succeed on failed Perception checks, but at a cost of 2 Health (burned) each time it activates. To keep it from activating, you’ll need to put the Stone back in your Pack. This Tool can be both a blessing and a curse, depending on how often you fail your checks. ",

The parent will automatically generate a table of content of its children, using the title property. If the summary property is mentionned, the entry will be written as title - summary. If it’s not, it will only be written as title. | . | The “permalink” property allows you to customize the URL of your page. It is, in fact, automatically generated, but you can tinker it further through this property. This can be useful to remove the “.html” at the end of the url, for example. If it is not mentionned, the permalink will be the path of the file, with the same name as your file at the end, but ended by .html instead of .md.

The format is the following: last_modified_date: 2020-04-27T17:54:08+0000 where the second half is a ISO 8601 formatted UNIX Timestamp.

Regardless, a Dog attacking with their teeth (a rank 1 Natural Dagger) would likely be more of a hindrance in combat than an asset after a certain point.

However, it can be easily extrapolated from the rules for upgrading Natural Weapons and crafting Armor. The trait requirement is the same as upgrading your Natural Weapon (see the table above). However, the Material cost is different. See the table below. | Defense Level | Material Cost | . | Civilian | 4 | . | Light, Medium or Heavy | 8 | . | Extreme or Impervious | 12 | . Much like upgrading a weapon, you must upgrade your companion’s Natural Defense by one step. Typically, this cost will be in Monster Parts. However, certain Monsters (typically Arcane and Mechanical Monsters) may use different Materials as determined by the GM. As examples: . | Armos Statues may use Metal or Stone | Guardians may use Ancient Materials | Hikkun may use Metal | Magmanos may use Stone or Rubies | Papetto may use Metal or Wood | . Similar to upgrading Natural Weapons, the exact method of upgrading Natural Armor can vary depending on the player and the recipient. An artificial being like an Armos or Papetto can simply have the Materials attached or sculpted to their bodies; a Guardian’s armor plating may simply be replaced; or an alchemical ritual can toughen up the scales or hide of a beast.

However it came to be, spirits and weapons unite to become artifacts of legend. For good or for ill, Weapon Spirits are ill-suited for obscurity–and few know better than a weapon’s own soul how to bring out its best performance. Weapon Spirits look like they’re made of the same material as their Weapon Form, whether that be Metal, Wood, or (after sufficient upgrades) Ancient Materials.They lack visible irises or pupils, and their body, clothing, and coloration often reflect aspects of their Weapon Form, whether its base or eventual fully-upgraded form. They often look very humanoid, but not entirely, and not always–they may have limbs made up by a cloak, for instance. Weapon Spirits also have gemstones protruding from one or more points on their body, such as the forehead and chest. Weapon Spirits don’t truly have a native territory or domain–they happen where and when they happen. Likewise, nobody is truly sure of how a Weapon Spirit comes to be born except the Goddesses. While some are spirits who agreed to take on this existence, others have never known any other. Relatedly, Weapon Spirits don’t have actual sexes. While that doesn’t hinder their appearances nor gender identities, whether that might be masculine, feminine, or somewhere inbetween, they lack any biology needed to reproduce on their own. ",

    "content": "Weapon Spirits are known for their faithfulness to their chosen allies and wielders. Even after a thousand years, they’ll still be trying to fulfill the goals of those they’ve lost, or to resurrect them entirely; time is no factor in their immortal minds. Art by GarbageKeeper, on DeviantArt . Weapon Spirits’ interests in new cultures varies from individual to individual, but for those who face decades or centuries of disuse between outings, it can seem pointless to bother remembering the details. For those that frequently interact with new people, on the other hand, they might find it more worthwhile to put effort into meeting people on their own level–even going so far as to use Impa’s Disguise to facilitate interactions without being seen as frightening, or as ‘merely an object.’ . There are two quintessential ways a Weapon Spirit can participate in battle. The first is inhabiting their Weapon Form, supporting another Hero in their trials. In this way, the Weapon may allow the wielder to use techniques they don’t normally know, or bestow supportive effects–spells and techniques used by the Spirit. Alternatively, the Weapon Spirit may choose to stand on the frontlines themselves, wielding their Weapon Form. This lacks the natural synergy of weapon and wielder, but allows them to make their own story and support their allies in other ways. Ultimately, a Weapon Spirit will likely use a mix of both methods across their lifetime. Lastly, in case a Weapon Spirit is worrying that they don’t recover enough Durability at once, remember to make friends with your local blacksmiths. Weapon Forms, as Repairable Weapons, can recover Durability by being repaired at a Forge. Characteristics: Loyal, Perceptive, Decisive, Patient, Sharp, Bold, Theatrical, Calculating . Weapon Spirit Names, despite what one might expect at first, share little in common with the name of the weapon itself. Instead, the spirit will often find a name by taking an onomatopoeia or other word related to their original weapon type and cutting it down into a one- or two-syllable fragment. Later in life, they may take a more normal-sounding name from another race, to help blend in and interact with them. Names: Swi, Fu, Cho, Shu, Fwi, Tho, Tsuru . ",

    "content": "It may seem obvious on the face of it, but a Weapon Spirit’s existence is defined by their being the personal incarnation of a weapon. What isn’t immediately obvious, though, is how this can affect the spirit’s mentality and views on various matters. That a Weapon Spirit would be more comfortable with and quicker to suggest violence as a solution is only the most readily apparent such instance. For example, a weapon is constantly in close proximity to its wielder, and invading an enemy’s personal space is inherently necessary to attacking them. As such, Weapon Spirits can often develop a distinct lack of concept of personal space, moving in closer than others are comfortable to get their points across, or just as a casual gesture. Another way being a weapon can affect the spirit is their concept of purpose and fate. A weapon belongs to others, and is always a tool of violence, whether to attack or defend. For many, this translates as a firm loyalty and acknowledgement that violence is a part of life, though how far one goes in each is up to the individual. Others, however, may question this–and question why they, themselves, have to exist as part of it. Rebellion is not impossible, just rare. ",

Witches have been a small, recurring part in the Zelda franchise since its inception, primarily taking the form of an old woman who sells Link restorative potions. Part of Link’s journey from the very first game onwards, it’s not unfair to say that many players would never have rescued Zelda if not for these old crones’ assistance. However, there are other witches that various Links interact with, such as Maple and Irene, who take a more active role in the world. They both help and hinder Link in his quest, as they bounce around on their own adventures. Of course, these witches can only move so quickly thanks to their signature conveyance: the Witch’s Broom. And in this article, we’ll talk about what a Witch’s Broom can do in your own Reclaim the Wild game, as well as how to craft your very own personalized, customized, souped-up Broom! . ",

Further, only trained Witches know the mystic secrets to crafting their own Brooms. Whether your Hero begins their career as a Witch, or learns the secrets of witchcraft later in their journey, their ability to ride and craft Brooms is represented with the Broomcraft Feat, below. New Feat: Broomcraft . 3 Tokens Requirement: Quest Reward or GM Approval Only Effect: You can now craft Witch’s Brooms. If you are using the Master Mode rules for Witch’s Broom proficiency, you can now pilot a Witch’s Broom without suffering the Slick Terrain Penalty at the end of your turn. Starting with a Broom . Witch’s Brooms are relatively expensive to craft (see below), so a player cannot start the game with one without a GM’s permission. Keep in mind, however, that many a young Witch’s training ends with a quest to craft their very own Broom, providing both a strong reason to not begin with a Broom, and a potent plot-hook to get the young Witch out of their teacher’s house and on the road to adventure. More experienced Witches may have suffered some hardship that ruined their previous Broom, or may be trying to ‘blend in’ with more mundane people, and thus have left their previous Broom behind. If the GM does decide to allow a player to begin with a Broom, we recommend keeping the Broom to either Rank 1 or Rank 0, depending on the character and their circumstances. We also recommend replacing one of the character’s starting Tools with their starting Broom. ",

If a Broom is damaged, you can repair it, so long as it hasn’t reached 0 HP. During a Short or Extended Rest, you may consume one Gem, Monster Part, Cloth, or Wood, restoring 1 HP per (Material’s Rank). The exception to this is Gems, which restore (Material’s Rank x 4) HP.

    "title": "Crafting a Broom",
    "content": "For many Witches, crafting their own Broom is an important rite of passage. A young Witch’s teacher will typically require the youth to procure the materials and construct the Broom all by themselves – a kind of final thesis statement, demonstrating everything the young Witch has learned. To craft a Broom, you must spend an Extended Rest (typically, a full day) in the act of crafting, casting, and concentrating. The exact methods and principles of Broom-crafting are closely held secrets, and vary from one Witch to the next – making it a great opportunity to explore how your Witch does things, and what that says about them. Crafting a Broom does not require a Forge, but it does require a heatsource, like Cooking does. You might use a campfire, a house’s kitchen, or yes, even a Forge. Crafting a Broom consumes: . | 1 Unit of Wood | 3 Gems (of any type, mix-and-match) | 5 Units of Cloth | 7 Monster Parts | . …all of the same Rank. This creates a Witch’s Broom of that Rank. (You can, of course, use higher-Ranked Materials, but the Broom will be of the lowest-Ranked unit of Material used in its construction.) . The Rank of Materials you can use to craft a Broom is limited by your Enchanting Trait: you may only use Materials of a Rank equal to (Enchanting / 2) or less. Deconstructing a Broom . Brooms can be deconstructed, much like most things. This might come up if your Heroes defeat an evil Witch, but don’t want to use her ill-gotten Broom; or if they make a new, spiffier Broom, and want to dispose of last year’s model. Deconstructing a Broom returns 1 Gem, 2 Cloth, and 3 Monster Parts, of the Broom’s Rank. Upgrading a Broom . Brooms can be upgraded, allowing you to improve their abilities and alter their Personal Touches (below). Upgrading a Broom is mechanically the same as creating a new Broom, and deconstructing the old Broom at the same time: you consume Materials to create your new Broom at the new Rank, and you receive the Materials of the Broom’s old Rank from deconstructing it. Personal Touches . When you craft a Broom, you also decide on its Personal Touches, much like when you build a Castle using the rules found in Rebuild the Wild. Brooms may have up to (Rank) many Personal Touches. Each Personal Touch may only be taken once, unless otherwise stated. Below are just a handful of the Personal Touches your Broom might have – but don’t be afraid to discuss your own ideas for Personal Touches with your GM! . | Attuned: This Broom is specifically attuned to you. Treat this as if the Broom had the “Loyal” Enchantment on it, of a Rank equal to the Broom’s Rank. Further, anyone who does not have your explicit permission to pilot this Broom will suffer the “Slick Terrain Penalty” as if they did not have the Broomcraft Feat. | Clean Sweep: During an Extended Rest, you may take a few minutes to use your Broom as an actual cleaning instrument, sweeping up your immediate surroundings. This produces a single Critter, based on the terrain you’re in, of a Rank up to (the Broom’s Rank). This does not prevent you from seeking out or harvesting other Materials during that Extended Rest. | Cupholders: Your Broom has (Rank / 2) cupholders, or other small containers that can easily be accessed while riding on your Broom. Treat these as Hip slots, accessible to any person(s) currently riding the Broom or otherwise adjacent to it. | Enchanted, Dark: As a Minor action, this Broom’s rider may command it to exude acrid black smoke from its bristles, covering the squares it traverses for the remainder of the turn. Perception checks made through the smoke take a (Rank) penalty, and light sources within the smoke have their Rank (or radius) reduced by (Rank). | Enchanted, Light: This Broom is enchanted with light. It may exude light as a Lantern of its Rank would, in either a Burst or a Cone; it may also leave a thin line of light behind it as it flies through the sky. The Broom’s rider may change the light’s shape, its color, dim it (reducing its Rank temporarily), direct it, or completely turn it on or off, as a Minor Action. | Glamoured: The Broom is enchanted with a glamour, changing the appearance of itself and anyone riding on it. It might look like a cloud, to hide in the sky; or it might look like a flying saucer, to really draw attention. The Broom’s pilot may activate and deactivate this glamour as a Minor Action. You may select this Personal Touch more than once, each time selecting a different glamour to add to the Broom’s repertoire. | Room for More: Your Broom takes up an additional (Rank / 2) squares, and thus has room for (Rank / 2) additional Creatures to sit upon it. This might be in the form of a motorcycle-style sidecar, a basket hanging beneath it, or the broom may simply be longer than normal. Regardless, only one person (the Pilot) may be in control of the Broom at a time. | Shrinkable: This Broom can shrink and grow back to size on command. (This does not allow its pilot to shrink with it, nor any items kept in cupholders.) It can be safely placed within a Pack’s Key Items pouch, rather than in the Tools pouch. It can also easily be used when the Hero is under the effects of any shrinking effects that the Broom was not also affected by. | Sorcerer’s Broom: Your Broom is capable of moving, acting, and maybe even thinking, all on its own. At Ranks 0-1, it has Instinctual intelligence, capable of following you and reacting to stimuli, but unable to follow commands. At Ranks 2-3, it possesses Limited intelligence, and can follow short commands and perform some simple tasks on its own, rather like a dog. At Ranks 4-5, the Broom has Rational intelligence, and is as smart and capable as you or I, and may even be able to speak. Regardless of the Broom’s intelligence, it does not count against your number of Companions. | Sorcerer’s Brooms, unlike other Brooms, have a Concentration, Evasion, and Vitality of (10 + (Rank x 2)). They can even use the “Strike” and “Sweep” Basic Attacks, rolling (3 + Rank + 2d6) To-Hit, and dealing ((Rank + 1) x 4) Blunt damage if the attack lands. Note that using this attack still consumes the Hero’s Standard Action. Thus, while Sorcerer’s Brooms can fight back on their own, they’re generally well outclassed by even a moderately skilled Hero. | Generally speaking, Sorcerer’s Brooms will object to being deconstructed. They may also take things too far or too literally when given orders. Be aware of the consequences when your Broom can think for itself! | . | Weatherproof: Select one type of Weather. This Broom, and all persons riding this Broom, treat that selected Weather as (Rank) Ranks lower when calculating its effect on them. This Personal Touch may be chosen multiple times, each time selecting a different Weather. | . ",

    "content": "Brooms, as a kind of unique vehicle, invite a certain level of complexity. By default, much of this complexity is pushed aside in the name of simple fun, as is the general style of Reclaim the Wild. However, if you wish to see Brooms be harder to pilot without practice, less maneuverable than a person on the ground, or even unrepairable at all, then read on. Unpracticed Pilot Penalty . You may wish for Broom-riding to be limited solely to Witches, something that most mundane folks can’t up-and-do, even if they somehow got their hands on a Witch’s Broom. If so, then this Master Mode rule is for you. For inexperienced Witches, Brooms can be a bit difficult to control, which can lead to them bumping into things, or even falling off their Broom. This is known as the Unpracticed Pilot Penalty: If the Broom’s pilot does not possess the Broomcraft feat (above), then at the end of their turn, they must roll as if they were on either a Slightly Slick surface (if they used half or less of the Broom’s Movement) or a Severely Slick surface (if they used more than half of the Broom’s Movement). This roll occurs even if the Broom’s pilot would otherwise be immune to Slick surfaces. Turning Radius . You may wish Brooms, being something like a vehicle, to have an additional issue that Companions do not: a turning radius. With this Master Mode rule, Brooms may be faster than most creatures on the ground, but they are also less maneuverable. While on a Broom: . | Generally, you may only turn up to 90 degrees from your starting facing during a single turn on a Broom. This means you can end your turn facing ‘right’ or ‘left’ from where you were, but no more than that. | Before you make any movement, you may declare your Broom Slowed for the remainder of your turn. If you do so, you may turn up to 180 degrees from your starting facing while on the Broom. This means you can turn completely around over the course of your (Slowed!) turn. | If you Sprint (moving twice the Broom’s Movement), you cannot turn more than 45 degrees from your initial heading, give or take. This means Sprinting on a Broom is best used for a direct dash or charge, when you’re already lined up with where you need to be! . | . Irreparable Brooms . As a Master Mode rule, your GM may disallow Broom repair. This brings Brooms into line with Weapons and most other equipment, which cannot be safely repaired unless inhabited by a Weapon Spirit. ",

You finish summoning the Phantom at the beginning of your next turn. By default, this Phantom is armed with an ephemeral sword and shield. The Phantom functions as a temporary Companion allied with you: you share your Actions with it, and it cannot act without your say-so. The Phantom has a Vulnerability to Light damage. Any damage done to the Phantom is instead Burned from your MP, after accounting for the Phantom’s Defense. If an attack would take you to 0 Magic or below, then any remaining damage after taking you to 0 Magic is done to your Health, and the Phantom disappears. (You may also dismiss the Phantom as a Free Action during your turn after you’ve summoned it; it cannot be dismissed on the same turn it is summoned.) However the Phantom is made to disappear, the Magic Bound in it is returned. When you finish summoning the Phantom (at the start of the turn after you cast this Spell), the Phantom may, as a Free Action, perform a Basic Attack, the Charge action, or the Defend action. It may take this Free Action before or after moving, as desired. The Phantom is of Limited intelligence. It can equip weapons and use most Tools, if directly told how to do so. It cannot craft items, speak with others, or think up new ideas on its own. Phantoms cannot equip armor (since they are made of armor). Phantoms do not know anything that their caster doesn’t know. Phantoms can perform simple actions, but not overly complex ones – roughly, they can do the kinds of things you could reasonably ask a silent, obedient child to do. For example, a Phantom can trot over to a Treasure Chest and open it (and even use a Small Key to do so), but it cannot pick the Chest’s lock or search it for traps. The Phantom is capable of using the Charge, Defend, Deflect, Intercept, and Parry actions, as well as the Basic Attacks appropriate to its wielded weapon(s), but it cannot use Spells or Techniques. The Phantom’s equipment is as ephemeral as it is; if the Phantom drops its sword or shield, those items will disappear at the end of its next turn. However, if you hand the Phantom other weapons to use, it may equip and wield that gear just like any Hero could. You may only have one Phantom summoned at a time. If you summon a second Phantom, your previous Phantom is automatically dispelled, as if you had dismissed it. The Phantom’s stats are based upon how much MP you Bind to it. The more MP Bound to the Phantom, the more powerful it is. | Defense: 6 + (3 * (MP Bound / 4)) | Evasion: 4 + (MP Bound / 4) | Concentration: 10 + (MP Bound / 4) | Vitality: 10 + (MP Bound / 2) | Strike To-Hit Roll: 3 + (MP Bound / 2) + 2d6 | Strike Damage: (MP Bound x 1.5), rounded down | Power Traits: (MP Bound / 2) | Courage and Wisdom Traits: (MP Bound / 4) | .

    "content": "The Phantom’s exact appearance is defined by you when you learn this spell. Typically, Phantoms appear as burly suits of armor, empty but for glowing eyes. The circumstances of how you learn the spell, or who you learn it from, might impact how your Phantom appears – as might its default equipment or its stat loadout. GMs may, as an option, allow the Hero learning the Zelda’s Phantom spell to wield a different set of default weapons. For instance, one Hero’s Phantom might use a Staff, while another might use a Bow. (If a Phantom uses a weapon that consumes Ammunition, such as a Bow or Crossbow, it can fire an infinite amount of generic shots. If you wanted it to use fancier ammo, like Fire Arrows, you’d need to obtain those elsewhere and then hand them to the Phantom once it’s summoned.) . Another option at the GM’s disposal is to alter the stats of the summoned Phantom. For instance, the Phantom might be a more nimble assassin-type rather than the classical heavily-armored warrior. Of course, the GM could decide to grant the Phantom even further modifications: an elemental theme, the benefits of some particular Race or monster, and so on. Below are two further stat-blocks for simple “Rogue” and “Wizard”-archetype Phantoms. They use different weapons, and have slightly different statistics, than the classic, heavily-armored “Fighter” archetype (above). Rogue . Wields a Dagger and Crossbow (and thus, is capable of using both the “Strike” and the “Shoot Arrow” Basic Attacks). | Defense: 4 + (2 * (MP Bound / 4)) | Evasion: 8 + (MP Bound / 2) | Concentration: 10 + (MP Bound / 3) | Vitality: 10 + (MP Bound / 3) | Basic Attack To-Hit Roll: 4 + (MP Bound / 2) + 2d6 | Basic Attack Damage: (MP Bound x 1.5), rounded down | Courage Traits: (MP Bound / 2) | Power and Wisdom Traits: (MP Bound / 4) | . Wizard . Wields a Staff (and thus, is capable of using the Basic Attack “Use Staff”). | Defense: 2 + (MP Bound / 4) | Evasion: 10 + (MP Bound / 4) | Concentration: 10 + (MP Bound / 2) | Vitality: 10 + (MP Bound / 4) | Basic Attack To-Hit Roll: 4 + (MP Bound / 2) + 2d6 | Basic Attack Damage: (MP Bound x 1.5), rounded down | Wisdom Traits: (MP Bound / 2) | Courage and Power Traits: (MP Bound / 4) | . Regardless of how the GM changes up the Spell, it should be considered a wholly separate Spell from any other instances of Zelda’s Phantom that a character knows. Once a Hero knows any version of Zelda’s Phantom, further variations should be considered 6-Token Spells, rather than 9-Token – after all, different types of Phantoms don’t offer quite as much additional utility as being able to summon one in the first place.
